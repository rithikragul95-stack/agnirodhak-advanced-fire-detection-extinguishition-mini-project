# AGNIRODHAK – Automated Fire Detection & Extinguishing System 🔥🚒

## 📌 Problem Statement
Fire accidents pose serious threats to life and property due to delayed detection and human dependency. Traditional fire alarm systems only alert users but do not take immediate action to suppress fire.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
AGNIRODHAK is an automated fire detection and extinguishing system that detects fire using an IR flame sensor and automatically activates a water pump and buzzer without human intervention.

## ⚙️ System Overview
- Detects fire using infrared radiation
- Automatically sprays water to extinguish fire
- Alerts nearby people using an audible buzzer
- Battery-powered and portable
- Low-cost and easy to implement

## 🧠 Technologies & Concepts Used
- IR Flame Sensor
- BD140 PNP Transistor (Switching & Amplification)
- DC Water Pump
- Embedded Electronics
- Power Management using TP4056

## 🔌 Hardware Components
- IR Flame Sensor Module
- BD140 PNP Transistor
- 3V DC Water Pump
- 5V Active Buzzer
- 1kΩ Resistor
- 3.7V Li-ion Battery
- TP4056 Charging Module
- Switch

## 🧪 Working Principle
1. IR sensor continuously monitors flame radiation
2. Flame detection triggers sensor output LOW
3. BD140 transistor switches ON
4. Water pump sprays water to extinguish fire
5. Buzzer alerts nearby personnel
6. System resets after fire is extinguished
